# **Football Player Analysis using Computer Vision**

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages computer vision to deliver detailed football match analysis. The primary objectives are:
- **Detect and track players** in real-time.
- **Estimate speed** and **distance covered** by each player.
- **Adjust for camera movement** to ensure precise tracking across the field.
- Visualize player positions using **heatmaps** for a deeper understanding of movement patterns.

The system uses powerful tools like **OpenCV**, **YOLOv8**, and **Supervision** to capture and analyze player movements, providing actionable insights into their performance on the field. This solution can assist coaches, analysts, and sports enthusiasts in gaining a comprehensive understanding of player dynamics.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Player Detection and Object Tracking**
   - The project employs **YOLOv8x** (You Only Look Once) object detection to identify players on the field with high accuracy.
   - Advanced **object tracking** ensures that each player's movements are monitored throughout the game, even with complex scenarios such as overlapping players or crowded regions.
   - The system is designed to distinguish between players, referees, and other entities, ensuring reliable tracking.

### 2. **Speed Estimation**
   - Using the detected positions of players over time, the system computes the **instantaneous speed** of each player.
   - A **pixel-to-meter** conversion is applied, considering camera perspective and field dimensions, delivering accurate speed measurements in meters per second (m/s).

### 3. **Distance Covered by Each Player**
   - The project calculates the **total distance covered** by each player during the match by tracking their movement paths.
   - The system provides real-time data on player endurance and positioning, which is valuable for tactical analysis and fitness assessments.

### 4. **Camera Movement Adjustment**
   - Football matches are typically filmed using dynamic camera movements (e.g., pan, tilt, zoom). This system incorporates **camera motion correction** techniques to ensure tracking precision.
   - This adjustment is crucial for maintaining accurate player positions and ensuring reliable speed and distance metrics.

### 5. **Player Heatmap Visualization**
   - To enhance player tracking analysis, the system generates **heatmaps** showing the concentration of each player's movements throughout the game.
   - These heatmaps provide visual insights into **where players spend the most time on the field**, revealing patterns that can help in tactical evaluations, such as identifying defensive or offensive zones.
   - Heatmaps offer a powerful way to understand player behavior, positioning, and overall field coverage during a match.

## **Technologies Used**

- **OpenCV**: For image processing, object tracking, and camera movement adjustments.
- **YOLOv8**: A state-of-the-art object detection algorithm to accurately detect and track football players in real-time.
- **Supervision**: Used for tracking player paths and providing actionable feedback on their performance.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing player heatmaps and generating intuitive graphical representations of player movements.
- **Numpy & Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and calculations related to speed, distance, and player positions.

## **How It Works**

1. **Detection and Tracking**: 
   - The system detects players using YOLOv8 and tracks their movements across frames. Each player is assigned a unique ID for continuous tracking throughout the game.

2. **Speed and Distance Calculation**:
   - Player coordinates are recorded in each frame, and speed is calculated using the displacement of a player between frames, adjusted for camera perspective. The cumulative distance covered is calculated as the sum of these displacements.

3. **Camera Motion Adjustment**:
   - The system dynamically adjusts for camera movement to ensure that player positions remain accurate, regardless of panning, zooming, or tilting.

4. **Heatmap Generation**:
   - The player’s positional data is aggregated to create heatmaps. These visualizations display the areas of the field where a player spends the most time, providing insights into their roles and tactical deployment.

## **Use Cases**
- **Performance Analysis**: Get insights into players' speed, stamina, and movement efficiency.
- **Tactical Evaluation**: Analyze player positioning and field coverage through heatmaps to inform coaching strategies.
- **Injury Prevention**: Monitor excessive movement patterns or overuse that could lead to injury risks.
- **Scouting**: Understand a player’s work rate, positioning, and contribution to the game with detailed visual and statistical data.

## **Future Work**
- Integration of **team-level heatmaps** to compare team dynamics and formations.
- Development of **real-time dashboards** for live match analysis.
- Incorporating more advanced **pose estimation** to track body angles and improve technical analysis.
